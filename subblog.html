                <strong>To turn over a new leaf</strong>
            </p>
            
            
                <p>As a Civil Engineer, I am a Civil Engineer, not a software developer. 
                    Or at least that’s what I thought. This is the story of how I 
                    followed my passion of becoming a software developer.
                </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The beginning</strong>
            </p>
            
            
                <p>It all began on a fine thursday afternoon. It was 2pm, 
                    the sky was blue, the streets were empty and I was 
                    out on my daily walk, breathing in the fresh, covid-free 
                    air. </p>

                <p>I love my walks. I find walking to be one of the rocks in 
                    my life. Walks center me and bring me back to my base. 
                    They’re a time where I can breathe, relax, and consider, 
                    and evaluate my thoughts and feelings. And on this calm 
                    day, birds chirping atop their tall trees, a day where I 
                    would typically have felt at peace, energised, and happy,
                     I was instead feeling distracted and dissatisfied; 
                     something in my life wasn’t as it should be.
                </p>

                <p> Employment nowadays, is a fundamental and time intensive 
                    part of life. A few years ago, I fostered a very close 
                    bond with a beautiful puppy (he wasn’t a puppy but all dogs
                    are puppies in my eyes) named Louie. Louie’s dad was the 
                    to-be CEO of the engineering consultancy I have been 
                    employed by for the last few years. I also tutored his 
                    daughter in maths but a dog’s approval is a massive 
                    credibility statement. I enjoy my work in civil engineering
                     as I love to problem solve. But I also had to acknowledge 
                     this feeling in my gut that was drawing me towards software
                      development. And in the clarity of the fresh air on this 
                      wonderful day, I realised as silly as it sounds, that I 
                      didn’t have to have a software development qualification 
                      or be a software developer by trade to know how to develop
                     software. Anyone can do it! And so I decided that it was 
                     time to turn a new leaf, and begin my unexpected journey 
                     into the digital world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My journey started from the bottom. After deciding upon my 
                    new pursuit, I quickly realised how little I knew about 
                    where to start without re-enrolling in a computer science 
                    qualification at university. I needed wisdom from the 
                    inside, and so I called upon my already qualified friends 
                    for some insight - what do I need to do to make myself a 
                    competent software developer?    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The three people I contacted all offered some excellent 
                    suggestions and with a bit of thought and extra research, 
                    I have constructed a pathway to my goal of becoming a 
                    software developer. This blog will detail the steps I have 
                    taken and the steps I am yet to take on my unexpected 
                    journey.

                </p>

            
                
            <p>
                <strong>The very first step</strong>
            </p>    

                <p>
                    In my eyes, the main fundamental to becoming a software 
                    developer (software dev) is learning your first language. 
                    Languages are the interaction between the computer and the 
                    individual and there are languages serving all types of 
                    purposes and utilities. Some are more common than others, 
                    notable names being Python, JavaScript, C (and it’s 
                    descendants C++, C# etc…), HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, and 
                    others. My friend recommended I begin learning JavaScript 
                    and he directed me to a brilliant and free learning 
                    platform - FreeCodeCamp.org. He said I should complete 
                    their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 
                    Certification, a 300hour course which took me approximately 
                    1 month, spending between 1-6 hours per day working through 
                    their interactive courses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    FreeCodeCamp.org was the perfect place to start for me 
                    because their JavaScript program eases the user into the 
                    development environment, providing the user with clear 
                    instructions and explanations of all the topics, each 
                    introduced at a very natural progression rate. The platform 
                    gives the user a series of tasks, explanations, and 
                    examples and then adjacent to this information, there is a 
                    built in integrated development environment (IDE) in which 
                    you can script your solutions and run them against the 
                    pre-existing test queries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I feel that this course is the perfect place to begin 
                    because it provides the user with their first tier of 
                    credibility; the user can now interact with the software 
                    development world. The user has their first tool in their 
                    tool kit to start building their profile and portfolio 
                    as a software developer, even being able to complete 
                    coding exams is a great feeling! The additional benefit 
                    of selecting JavaScript as a first language is that it 
                    can be used for full-stack development. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    - a brief interlude as ‘full-stack’ was a term whose 
                    meaning eluded me for a while. In development, there 
                    is front-end development, which involves the creation 
                    and development of the client side interface or user 
                    experience. Conversely, there is back-end development 
                    which communicates front-end information and inputs 
                    to databases where data is organised and stored. 
                    Full-stack development is when the developer develops 
                    both front-end and back-end systems. -
