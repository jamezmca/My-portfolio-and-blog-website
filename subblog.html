                <strong>To turn over a new leaf</strong>
            </p>
            
            
                <p>As a civil engineer, I am a civil engineer, not a software developer. 
                    Or at least that’s what I thought. This is the story of how I 
                    followed my passion of becoming a software developer.
                </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The beginning</strong>
            </p>
            
            
                <p>It all began on a fine thursday afternoon. It was 2pm, 
                    the sky was blue, the streets were empty and I was 
                    out on my daily walk, breathing in the fresh, covid-free 
                    air. </p>

                <p>I love my walks. I find walking to be one of the rocks in 
                    my life. Walks center me and bring me back to my base. 
                    They’re a time where I can breathe, relax, and consider, 
                    and evaluate my thoughts and feelings. And on this calm 
                    day, birds chirping atop their tall trees, a day where I 
                    would typically have felt at peace, energised, and happy,
                     I was instead feeling distracted and dissatisfied; 
                     something in my life wasn’t as it should be.
                </p>

                <p> Employment nowadays, is a fundamental and time intensive 
                    part of life. A few years ago, I fostered a very close 
                    bond with a beautiful puppy (he wasn’t a puppy but all dogs
                    are puppies in my eyes) named Louie. Louie’s dad was the 
                    to-be CEO of the engineering consultancy I have been 
                    employed by for the last few years. I also tutored his 
                    daughter in maths but a dog’s approval is a massive 
                    credibility statement. I enjoy my work in civil engineering
                     as I love to problem solve. But I also had to acknowledge 
                     this feeling in my gut that was drawing me towards software
                      development. And in the clarity of the fresh air on this 
                      wonderful day, I realised as silly as it sounds, that I 
                      didn’t have to have a software development qualification 
                      or be a software developer by trade to know how to develop
                     software. Anyone can do it! And so I decided that it was 
                     time to turn a new leaf, and begin my unexpected journey 
                     into the digital world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My journey started from the bottom. After deciding upon my 
                    new pursuit, I quickly realised how little I knew about 
                    where to start without re-enrolling in a computer science 
                    qualification at university. I needed wisdom from the 
                    inside, and so I called upon my already qualified friends 
                    for some insight - what do I need to do to make myself a 
                    competent software developer?    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The three people I contacted all offered some excellent 
                    suggestions and with a bit of thought and extra research, 
                    I have constructed a pathway to my goal of becoming a 
                    software developer. This blog will detail the steps I have 
                    taken and the steps I am yet to take on my unexpected 
                    journey.

                </p>

            
                
            <p>
                <strong>The very first step</strong>
            </p>    

                <p>
                    In my eyes, the main fundamental to becoming a software 
                    developer (software dev) is learning your first language. 
                    Languages are the interaction between the computer and the 
                    individual and there are languages serving all types of 
                    purposes and utilities. Some are more common than others, 
                    notable names being Python, JavaScript, C (and it’s 
                    descendants C++, C# etc…), HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, and 
                    others. My friend recommended I begin learning JavaScript 
                    and he directed me to a brilliant and free learning 
                    platform - FreeCodeCamp.org. He said I should complete 
                    their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 
                    Certification, a 300hour course which took me approximately 
                    1 month, spending between 1-6 hours per day working through 
                    their interactive courses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    FreeCodeCamp.org was the perfect place to start for me 
                    because their JavaScript program eases the user into the 
                    development environment, providing the user with clear 
                    instructions and explanations of all the topics, each 
                    introduced at a very natural progression rate. The platform 
                    gives the user a series of tasks, explanations, and 
                    examples and then adjacent to this information, there is a 
                    built in integrated development environment (IDE) in which 
                    you can script your solutions and run them against the 
                    pre-existing test queries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I feel that this course is the perfect place to begin 
                    because it provides the user with their first tier of 
                    credibility; the user can now interact with the software 
                    development world. The user has their first tool in their 
                    tool kit to start building their profile and portfolio 
                    as a software developer, even being able to complete 
                    coding exams is a great feeling! The additional benefit 
                    of selecting JavaScript as a first language is that it 
                    can be used for full-stack development. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    - a brief interlude as ‘full-stack’ was a term whose 
                    meaning eluded me for a while. In development, there 
                    is front-end development, which involves the creation 
                    and development of the client side interface or user 
                    experience. Conversely, there is back-end development 
                    which communicates front-end information and inputs 
                    to databases where data is organised and stored. 
                    Full-stack development is when the developer develops 
                    both front-end and back-end systems. -

                <p>
                    Congratulations! You can now write code. If you enjoyed 
                    your experience with FreeCodeCamp.org, you can also buy 
                    their cool hoodies to support their platform and also 
                    look cool with some hip swag.

                <p>
                    With your flash, new certification, it’s my opinion 
                    that you are now ready to download and set up your 
                    personal development environment so that you can 
                    script your own code. This step had me absolutely 
                    duped if I'm completely honest. Having had the luxury 
                    of FreeCodeCamp’s built-in coding environment, I 
                    genuinely had no idea where to write my own code. I 
                    tried writing it on some paper but I couldn’t find a run 
                    button so that didn’t work. But this is where the IDE 
                    comes in handy. IDE’s aren’t required for coding but they 
                    make life very easy. They allow you to script, run, and 
                    debug your code all inside one application. There are a 
                    plethora of different environments but my personal 
                    favorite for beginners is Visual Studio Code. It’s 
                    incredibly easy to set up and after adding extensions 
                    relevant to the languages you plan on using, you can 
                    install the Power Mode extension which leaves a flaming 
                    trail as you blaze along the screen with you 100 wpm 
                    scripting speed.

                <strong>Looking cool on the interwebs</strong>

                <p>
                    When trying to catch large bears, you first have to go 
                    through the long wavy grass (learning your first language). 
                    Naturally, after traversing the long grass, you have to 
                    splash through the deep cold river, you can’t go over it and 
                    you can’t go under it. This is obviously representative of 
                    developing your professional image (on LinkedIn). It’s good 
                    to list your expertise and state your intentions. Spend time 
                    relating your current work experiences to software development, 
                    speaking to your history of problem solving, project management, 
                    team work, and communication. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also recently discovered that LinkedIn offers a badge certification 
                    system to your skills as well. The skills section is an important 
                    part of your profile as it denotes your proficiencies, which can 
                    now be accredited with LinkedIn badges. My first badge was the 
                    JavaScript badge. If you complete LinkedIn’s exam on a particular 
                    skill (they’re fairly challenging and you only get a limited 
                    number of opportunities to attempt it every period of time), 
                    and score in the top 30% of all applicants, then you can have 
                    LinkedIn’s stamp of approval next to the skill listed on your 
                    profile! I love badges and so I loved hearing this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, and this is entirely my opinion, choose a profile 
                    picture that you feel best represents you. I feel that 
                    professional images are boring and unauthentic but a picture 
                    of you with a big grin across your face out on your favorite 
                    hike, or doing something else that feels characteristic of 
                    you, gives people a personable and friendly impression of 
                    you :)
                </p>

                    Pro tip - make your website really detailed and keep your 
                    CV to one tidy page!

                </p>

            </p>
            
            
                <p>
                    Another great way to gain experience, familiarise yourself 
                    with the industry, and just generally enhance your experience 
                    as a software developer is to join related communities. 
                    I personally enjoy social networking and having the 
                    opportunity to engage with others and learn from their 
                    experience is a great way to feel enthused about the 
                    journey ahead. Speaking with individuals involved in the 
                    subsectors of software development that most excite you 
                    is another great way to guide your development experience 
                    and minimise the time you spend feeling lost along the way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first community I found was called Design Buddies. 
                    Design Buddies host numerous learning and socialising 
                    events that cater to all types of developers, and the 
                    community feels very inviting. I have also found that 
                    most universities have developer clubs that are easy 
                    to get involved with too!

                <strong>Creating the famed portfolio</strong>
            </p>
            
            
                <p>
                    Now it’s time for a bit of a project. You’ve become 
                    a competent user of your first language, and your 
                    public image is aligned with your developer goals, 
                    so now you’re more than ready to branch out and 
                    build your own website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why build a website, you might ask. You’ve already 
                    got a CV and a neat looking LinkedIn page, surely 
                    that’s sufficient? If you’re asking these questions, 
                    you’re not wrong, but for me, building a website 
                    wasn’t about developing my public image; it was 
                    an exciting, learning opportunity where I could 
                    gain some knowledge on new languages, HTML and CSS, 
                    and also the thought of having a page, with my own 
                    URL that I could link people to, and completely 
                    personalise, was super exciting. And here is the

                <p>
                    Starting on this journey, I knew very little HTML 
                    and absolutely no CSS. But once again thanks to FreeCodeCamp.org, 
                    I found an excellent tutorial that walked me through the entire 
                    process of scripting a website. I was very excited to build my 
                    website from a tutorial as it represented a new learning style 
                    for a new language. As mentioned, completing the JavaScript 
                    certification through FreeCodeCamp.org was a efficacious 
                    experience and I would definitely recommend completing their 
                    HTML certification if web development is an area you’re 
                    excited about, but for me, I was not looking for another 
                    intensive educational experience on HTML immediately after 
                    what i’d done with JavaScript. And so I looked for a new 
                    educational methodology to learn the language and the 
                    website / portfolio building course gave me a highly 
                    interactive and rewarding (in the sense you end up 
                    with your own website) experience which kept my interests 
                    peaked and optimised my learning. For me, it has been 
                    very valuable to realise some of the different ways 
                    that one can learn a language and so I would definitely 
                    recommend this option for some variety.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By the end of the tutorial, I felt comfortable in the 
                    HTML and CSS environment and was capable of editing, 
                    reading, debugging, and scripting HTML and CSS. I 
                    constantly update my portfolio, adding new sections 
                    and further customising my online representation 
                    and I would totally recommend everyone does the same. 
                    I would also spend time on the text sections. As 
                    much as the website might look flash, the content 
                    is just as important. Make sure that you highlight 
                    your skills and experience so all readers gain cool 
                    insight into your capabilities whilst enjoying your 
                    aesthetic digital space.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And as much as this experience doesn’t have to be 
                    purposed with the sake of finding employment, it 
                    really will hike your credibility score well over 
                    9000. Especially if it’s customised to represent 
                    you. The options of what text you include, the 
                    depth in which you elaborate on your work experience 
                    and contributions, and even the style in which you 
                    write contribute to the image employers create of 
                    you before they meet you. New to the development 
                    world, where you probably don’t have any apps on 
                    the app store, or your own steam game, it’s 
                    important to convey your personality. Anyone 
                    can be taught to script code and make commits 
                    to GitHub, but not everyone is fun, considerate, 
                    and a capable communicator, or even a team player, 
                    leader, or innovator.

            </p>

                <p>
                    Isn’t it exciting to have your own website at an 
                    IP address? If you’re anything like me however, 
                    an IP address wasn’t going to cut the mustard; 
                    I needed my own website URL.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Purchasing a website URL is generally 
                    pretty easy and inexpensive, unless you’re 
                    looking to label it “afcebook.com”. 
                    GoDaddy is a provider of URL’s where 
                    you pay around $15 CAD per year to 
                    maintain ownership of your URL. If you 
                    create an account with them, you can 
                    then check the availability of your desired 
                    URL, purchase it, and then set it up to 
                    redirect users to your Digital Ocean website 
                    IP. I would recommend you rename the redictory 
                    website to your URL, so people see your URL 
                    instead of the website IP. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    You could also use your URL to redirect 
                    people to the following site:

                    Wow, you’re probably starting to feel quite accomplished now! 
                    I know I sure was. I couldn’t stop sending my website URL to 
                    people and had a lot of fun making it very unprofessional 
                    before I was instructed to make it marginally more professional. 
                    This could be a great time to start investigating new languages. 
                    If any particular field of software development interests you, 
                    don’t be afraid to throw yourself into the deep end with some 
                    new FreeCodeCamp.org courses or even some beginner projects on 
                    youtube to get you started. But it’s also important to practice 
                    what you’ve already learned. I found a great resource to keep 
                    you fresh with languages such as JavaScript is CodeWars. It’s 
                    a website that provides regular coding challenges that are 
                    engaging and the profile development is a lot of fun if you 
                    like being rewarded for your efforts. I also found personally 
                    that basic Python was not too dissimilar from JavaScript and 
                    that I was able to practice some beginner challenges with my 
                    new language there.

                <strong>Git, GitHub, Agile - the alien words</strong>
            </p>
            
            
                <p>
                    By now, I had heard the term Git or GitHub come up all 
                    over the place more than 1000 times over. I’d also heard 
                    terms such as Scrum and Agile pop up too. These soft-knowledge 
                    topics and skills are great to familiarise yourself with 
                    as not only will they help enhance your development 
                    lifestyle but they’re also integral to company mechanics 
                    and coding collectively. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Git and GitHub refer to a collaboration network where 
                    people regularly upload their code to a cloud database. 
                    More specifically, people use Git to upload to GitHub, 
                    and within GitHub, there are repositories (folders) 
                    which contain all versions of all uploaded projects. 
                    People are able to use Git to pull information and 
                    project work from GitHub, work on it, and push commits 
                    (essentially modifications with descriptions) back to 
                    GitHub, where the changes are clearly visible. This 
                    system allows everyone to collaborate on code and 
                    even allows the user to store their own code in a 
                    neat, cohesive, and efficient system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Terms like Agile are more representative of practices 
                    as a coder. Wikipedia defines it as “discovering requirements 
                    and developing solutions through the collaborative effort 
                    of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their 
                    customer(s)/end user(s)”. It’s a workplace way of working 
                    to optimise communication, individual productivity, 
                    and collective success as a team, achieving a shared outcome. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Scrum is a common Agile methodology / framework, providing 
                    iterative and incremental guidance along the lifespan of a 
                    project. The scrum framework specifically defines the 
                    organisational layout across two week periods, detailing 
                    how progress is tracked and key objectives of future work. 
                    Scrum is an  implementation of Agile practices (but there 
                    are numerous flavours of implementation).

                    There is far more information regarding all of these topics 
                    available than what I’ve described, but at least now 
                    you might understand what the words represent :)

                    Travelling a fair way down the list, we find ourselves looking 
                    for our next big challenge. To what do we wish to apply 
                    our new found skills? For me, it was an app. I wanted 
                    to have a finished product, one that I’ve shipped from 
                    cradle to grave. I’m still working on it at the moment 
                    and it’s far from complete. I also looked to build 
                    said app using languages that I already have a baseline 
                    familiarity with so I can further develop my capabilities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This was only the first of my plans however as I have 
                    always been a big game fanatic and I plan to complete 
                    a python scripting course that runs through the scripting, 
                    building, and implementation of multiple basic games - 
                    how exciting! The world is at your fingertips.
